### Features of calculator.py
  1. Supports basic arithmetic operations
         -> Addition (+)
         -> Subtraction (-)
         -> Multiplication (*)
         -> Division (/)

  2. User input from the command line
         The calculator accepts:
         -> First number
         -> Operation
         -> Second number
         -> All through standard input (input()).

  3. Error handling
         -> Prevents division by zero (shows: “Cannot divide by zero”)
         -> Handles invalid numeric input (ValueError)

  4. Clean and modular code
        Each operation is defined as its own function:
         -> add()
         -> subtract()
         -> multiply()
         -> divide()
         -> This helps in readability, reusability, and makes future expansion easy.

   5. Friendly interface
         Displays: 
        -> A title
        -> Available operations
        -> Clear prompts for user input
        -> A simple formatted output:
           Example → Result: 15.0

    6. Cross-platform 
        Runs on:
         -> Windows
         -> Linux
         -> macOS
         Anywhere Python is installed.
